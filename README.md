# :memo: About the Project

This application is a boilerplate for large or small systems, especially those that need of security and code quality.

In the construction of the UI, the Atomic Design structure was chosen, organizing the global components into atoms, molecules, organisms and templates.

In addition to being constantly updated, this project was configured in the smallest details to serve as a basis for professional projects that require standardized and easy-to-maintain code architecture and design.

# :rotating_light: Important Considerations

- The husky is configured to not allow commit if there are any lint and typescript errors. The push can only be done if all tests and builds pass.

- Due to husky's build check settings, to push with git, the development server must be stopped first or an error will occur in the `git push` command.

- Some conventions widely used in the React ecosystem were used. For example:

  - In the root of the components folder, an export index was created to facilitate the use of components with named import. In this way, to use a component just import it as an object and use it with the prefix "C", thus avoiding several unnecessary lines of imports:

    ```jsx
    import * as C from 'ui/components'

    ...
    <C.Card>
      <C.Input />
    </C.Card>
    ...
    ```
