# :rotating_light: Important Considerations

- The husky is configured to not allow commit if there are any lint and typescript errors. The push can only be done if all tests and builds pass.

- Due to husky's build check settings, to push with git, the development server must be stopped first or an error will occur in the `git push` command.

- Some conventions widely used in the React ecosystem were used. For example:

  - In the root of the components folder, an export index was created to facilitate the use of components with named import. In this way, to use a component just import it as an object and use it with the prefix "C", thus avoiding several unnecessary lines of imports:

    ```jsx
    import * as C from 'ui/components'

    ...
    <C.Card>
      <C.Input />
    </C.Card>
    ...
    ```

- To import style sheets that use styled-components, named imports were used for the same reason as before, thus:

   ```jsx
   import * as S from './styles'

   ...
   <S.Wrapper>
     <S.Title />
   </S.Wrapper>
   ...
   ```
